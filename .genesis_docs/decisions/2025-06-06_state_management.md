# State Management Decision: BLoC vs Riverpod

## Context
We needed to choose a state management solution for DocuLode that would:
- Scale well with the application
- Be maintainable and testable
- Have good developer experience
- Support complex state management needs

## Decision
We chose BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern over Riverpod for the following reasons:

### Advantages of BLoC
1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear separation between UI and business logic
   - Predictable state management
   - Easy to test business logic in isolation

2. **Scalability**
   - Well-suited for large applications
   - Easy to add new features without affecting existing ones
   - Good for team collaboration

3. **Testing**
   - Built-in support for testing
   - Easy to mock dependencies
   - Clear testing patterns

4. **Documentation and Community**
   - Extensive documentation
   - Large community support
   - Many examples and resources available

### Why Not Riverpod
While Riverpod is a great solution, we chose BLoC because:
1. Team familiarity with BLoC pattern
2. More mature ecosystem
3. Better suited for our specific use cases
4. Easier to maintain in the long term

## Consequences
### Positive
1. Consistent state management across the app
2. Easy to understand and maintain
3. Good testing coverage
4. Scalable architecture

### Negative
1. More boilerplate code compared to Riverpod
2. Steeper learning curve for new team members
3. Need to manage more files

## Implementation Notes
1. Use `flutter_bloc` package
2. Follow BLoC best practices
3. Create reusable BLoC components
4. Document BLoC usage patterns

## Future Considerations
1. Monitor BLoC performance
2. Consider code generation tools
3. Evaluate need for state management changes
4. Keep track of new state management solutions
